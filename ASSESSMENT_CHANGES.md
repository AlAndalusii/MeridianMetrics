# Assessment Flow Updates - October 2025

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Separated Contact Information from Main Questions

**Problem**: Users saw "Question 1 of 19" which felt overwhelming
**Solution**: Split into two phases:
- **Contact Phase**: "Step 1 of 4" for basic information
- **Assessment Phase**: "Question 1 of 15" for compliance questions

This makes the assessment feel shorter and more manageable.

#### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
const [isContactInfoPhase, setIsContactInfoPhase] = useState(true)
const contactInfoQuestions = 4
const assessmentQuestions = totalQuestions - contactInfoQuestions

// Progress bar adapts to current phase
const progress = isContactInfoPhase 
  ? ((currentStep + 1) / contactInfoQuestions) * 100
  : ((currentStep - contactInfoQuestions + 1) / assessmentQuestions) * 100
```

#### User Experience:
- First 4 questions show: "Step 1 of 4", "Step 2 of 4", etc.
- After completing contact info, message appears: "✨ Great! Now let's assess your compliance status"
- Compliance questions show: "Question 1 of 15", "Question 2 of 15", etc.
- Progress bar resets and starts fresh for the assessment phase
