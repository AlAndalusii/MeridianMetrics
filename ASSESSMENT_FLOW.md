## Mobile Considerations

- 60% of users expected on mobile

- Fast loading (no heavy images)
- Single column layout
- Progress bar always visible at top

## Trust & Security Messaging

1. **Top of Assessment**: "üîí Your information is confidential and never shared"
2. **Halfway Point**: "‚è±Ô∏è Almost done! Just 5 more questions"
3. **Navigation Badge**: Progress indicator in header
4. **Why This Matters**: Each question has explanation of importance

## Next Steps for Enhancement

Potential future improvements:
1. Email integration to actually send reports
2. PDF generation for downloadable reports
3. Database storage instead of localStorage only
4. Admin dashboard to view submissions
5. A/B testing different question orders
6. Integration with CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
7. Analytics tracking (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
8. Email follow-up sequences based on score
9. Calendar integration for booking calls (Calendly)
10. Payment integration for services

## Notes

- All "START YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT" buttons throughout the site now route to `/assessment`
- Assessment data persists across page refreshes via localStorage
- Users can close browser and return later to complete assessment
- Results page requires completion of assessment to access (redirects if no data)
- Conditional logic reduces friction by skipping irrelevant questions
