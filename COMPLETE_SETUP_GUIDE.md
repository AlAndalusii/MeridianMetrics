## 📋 Setup Checklist (10 Minutes Total)

### ☐ Step 1: Install Database Package (2 min)

```bash
npm install @vercel/postgres
```

### ☐ Step 2: Add Your Resend API Key (1 min)

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here
BUSINESS_EMAIL=zak@millstonecompliance.com
```

**Your Resend setup:**
```javascript
import { Resend } from 'resend';
const resend = new Resend('re_xxxxxxxxx'); // ← Replace this with your actual key
```

### ☐ Step 3: Set Up Vercel Postgres (3 min)

**Option A: Using Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to vercel.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Storage** tab
4. Click **Create Database**
5. Choose **Postgres**
6. Select **Free** tier
7. Click **Create**

Done! Vercel auto-injects the connection details.

**Option B: For Local Development**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Link your project
vercel link

# Pull environment variables (includes database connection)
vercel env pull .env.local
```

### ☐ Step 4: Initialize Database (1 min)

Visit this URL in your browser **once**:

**Local:**
```
http://localhost:3000/api/assessment/init-db
```

**Production:**
```
https://your-domain.com/api/assessment/init-db
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Database initialized successfully"
}
```

### ☐ Step 5: Restart Server (1 min)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### ☐ Step 6: Test Everything (2 min)

   - Go to http://localhost:3000/assessment
   - Start filling it out
   - Watch it auto-save!

2. **Test Admin Dashboard:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/admin

## 🎯 How It All Works Together

### User Journey:

```
1. User visits /assessment
    ↓
2. Unique session ID created
    ↓
3. User answers Question 1
    ↓
4. Saved to:
   ├─ localStorage (instant resume) ✅
   └─ Database (server-side tracking) ✅
    ↓
5. User answers Question 2
    ↓
6. Saved to:
   ├─ localStorage ✅
   └─ Database ✅
    ↓
... continues for each answer ...
    ↓
Two possible outcomes:

┌─────────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────────┐
│   USER COMPLETES        │  │   USER ABANDONS         │
├─────────────────────────┤  ├─────────────────────────┤
│ ✅ All answers saved     │  │ ⚠️ Partial answers saved │
│ ✅ Score calculated      │  │ ⚠️ Progress tracked      │
│ ✅ Marked complete in DB │  │ ⚠️ Marked abandoned      │
│ ✅ Redirected to results │  │ ⚠️ No email sent         │
│ ✅ Email to user         │  │ ✅ You can see in admin  │
│ ✅ Email to you          │  │ ✅ You can follow up     │
└─────────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────────┘
```

### Email Flow (Batch Sending):

```javascript
// When assessment completes:
await resend.batch.send([
  // Email 1: User Results
  {
    to: [userEmail],
    subject: "Your PPT Compliance Results - Score/100",
    html: beautifulResultsEmail
  },
  
  // Email 2: Business Notification
  {
    to: ['zak@millstonecompliance.com'],
    cc: ['zak@millstonecompliance.com'], // Ensures delivery
    subject: "🆕 New Assessment: Name (Company) - Score/100",
    html: completeDataEmail
  }
])
