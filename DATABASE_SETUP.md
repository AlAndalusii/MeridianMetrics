2. **Abandoned tracking** - See who started but didn't finish
3. **Admin dashboard** - View all submissions (complete + partial)
4. **Email follow-up** - Contact people who abandoned
5. **Analytics** - Completion rates, average scores, drop-off points
6. **CSV export** - Download all data for analysis

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @vercel/postgres
```

### Step 2: Add Vercel Postgres to Your Project

**Option A: Using Vercel (Recommended - Free Tier)**

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** tab
3. Click **Create Database**
4. Select **Postgres**
5. Choose **Free Tier** (250 hours/month - plenty for starting)
6. Click **Create**

That's it! Vercel automatically injects the environment variables.

**Option B: Local Development with Vercel Postgres**

If developing locally:

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link your project: `vercel link`
3. Pull environment variables: `vercel env pull .env.local`

### Step 3: Initialize Database Schema

Visit this URL in your browser (only do this once):

```
http://localhost:3000/api/assessment/init-db
```

Or in production:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/assessment/init-db
```

You should see: `{ "success": true, "message": "Database initialized successfully" }`

### Step 4: Test It!

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/assessment
2. Start answering questions
3. Open the admin dashboard: http://localhost:3000/admin
4. You should see your submission appear!

## 🔄 How It Works

### Data Flow:

```
User starts assessment
    ↓
Session ID generated (unique per user)
    ↓
User answers Question 1
    ↓
Saved to localStorage (instant) ✅
Saved to database (background) ✅
    ↓
User answers Question 2
    ↓
Saved to localStorage ✅
Saved to database ✅
    ↓
... continues for each answer ...
    ↓
Two scenarios:

Scenario A: User completes
    ↓
Final submission saved to DB with is_complete=true ✅
Results page loads ✅
Emails sent (user + you) ✅

Scenario B: User abandons at Question 7
    ↓
Database has Questions 1-7 ✅
You can see in admin dashboard ✅
Follow up via email ✅
```

### Database Schema:

```sql
assessment_submissions
├── id (primary key)
├── session_id (unique identifier)
├── name
├── email
├── company
├── phone
├── answers (JSON object with all answers)
├── score (null if not complete)
├── is_complete (true/false)
├── current_question (0-19)
├── created_at
├── updated_at
└── completed_at
```

## 📧 Email Updates

### Updated to Batch Sending

Now uses Resend's `batch.send()` for efficiency:

```typescript
await resend.batch.send([
  // Email 1: User results
  { to: [user.email], ... },
  
  // Email 2: Business notification
  { to: ['zak@millstonecompliance.com'], ... }
])
```

**All business emails go to:** `zak@millstonecompliance.com`

Plus CC to ensure delivery. You'll receive:
- Every completed assessment
- Full user data
- All answers
- Recommended service tier
