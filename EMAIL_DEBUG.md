# 📧 Email Debugging Steps

## ✅ What I Just Added

I added detailed logging to see exactly what Resend is returning. Now you'll see:

- 📧 Which emails are being sent to
- 📬 Full Resend response
- ✅ Success messages with batch ID
- ❌ Error messages if something fails

---

## 🔄 RESTART YOUR SERVER NOW

**IMPORTANT:** You must restart for the new logging to work!

### In your terminal:

1. **Stop the server:** Press `Ctrl+C`
2. **Restart:** 
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Note the new URL** - It's on port 3001 now:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001
   ```

---

## 🧪 Test Again

1. Go to: **http://localhost:3001/assessment** (note: 3001, not 3000!)
2. Complete the assessment
3. Watch your terminal for these new messages:

**You should see:**
```
📧 Attempting to send emails to: { user: 'your@email.com', business: 'zak@millstonecompliance.com' }
📬 Resend batch response: { ... }
✅ Emails sent successfully! Batch ID: xxx
```

**Or if there's an error:**
```
❌ Resend error: { ... }
```

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Success Case:
```
📧 Attempting to send emails to: { user: 'jama1887@outlook.com', business: 'zak@millstonecompliance.com' }
📬 Resend batch response: {
  "data": {
    "id": "batch_abc123...",
    ...
  }
}
✅ Emails sent successfully! Batch ID: batch_abc123
```

### Error Case:
```
❌ Resend error: {
  "message": "API key is invalid",
  "name": "validation_error"
}
```

---

## 🆘 Common Issues

### Issue: "API key is invalid"
**Solution:** 
- Double-check the key in `.env.local`
- Make sure there are no spaces before/after
- Get a fresh key from https://resend.com/api-keys

### Issue: "Domain not verified"
**This is expected!** Using `onboarding@resend.dev` works for testing.
**Solution:** Emails should still send. Check spam folders.

### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution:** Resend free tier: 100 emails/day. Wait or upgrade.

### Issue: "Invalid email address"
**Solution:** Make sure the email in the assessment is valid.

## 📧 Check Your Emails

After seeing "✅ Emails sent successfully", check:

1. **User's inbox:** jama1887@outlook.com
2. **Your inbox:** zak@millstonecompliance.com
3. **Spam folders** (important! Often ends up there)
4. **Resend dashboard:** https://resend.com/emails

---

## 🎯 Resend Dashboard

Go to: https://resend.com/emails

You should see:
- All sent emails
- Delivery status
- Any errors
- Bounce/complaint info

This is the **best** way to debug email issues!

---

## ✅ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Server restarted (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Using correct port (3001)
- [ ] Complete a test assessment
- [ ] Watch terminal for new emoji logs
- [ ] Check Resend dashboard
- [ ] Check spam folders

## 📸 What to Screenshot If Not Working

If emails still don't work, screenshot:

1. **Terminal output** showing the emoji logs
2. **Resend dashboard** at https://resend.com/emails
3. **Your `.env.local`** file (blur the API key!)
4. **Browser console** (F12 → Console tab)

---

**Restart your server now and test again!** 🚀

The detailed logs will tell us exactly what's happening.
