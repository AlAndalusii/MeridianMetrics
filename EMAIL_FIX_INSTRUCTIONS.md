# 🔧 Email Fix - Quick Solution

## ✅ What I Just Fixed

The email sending was failing due to a missing parameter. I've fixed the code, but you need to add your actual Resend API key.

---

## 🚨 **ACTION REQUIRED: Add Your Resend API Key**

### Step 1: Get Your Resend API Key

1. Go to: https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Copy your API key (starts with `re_`)
3. It should look like: `re_AbCdEfGh12345...`

### Step 2: Update `.env.local`

Open `/Users/jama/Documents/fieldmark-website-2/.env.local` and replace:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxx  ← REPLACE THIS!
```

With your actual key:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Server

**Important:** After adding the API key, you MUST restart the dev server:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

Environment variables only load on startup!

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

From your terminal output:

1. ✅ **Database working** - All those `POST /api/assessment/save 200` mean Supabase is saving perfectly!
2. ❌ **Email failing** - Error: `recommendation is not defined`
3. ✅ **Fixed!** - I added the missing parameter to the email function

Now it should work once you add your Resend API key.

## 📧 Email Configuration

The example you showed:
```javascript
import { Resend } from 'resend';
const resend = new Resend('re_xxxxxxxxx');
resend.apiKeys.create({ name: 'Production' });
```

**That's for CREATING a new API key.** You don't need to do that!

**Just use your existing key in `.env.local`:**

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key
```

Our code already does:
```javascript
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);
```

## 🧪 Test After Fix

1. **Add your Resend API key** to `.env.local`
2. **Restart server**: `npm run dev`
3. **Complete assessment** at http://localhost:3000/assessment
4. **Check emails:**
   - Your test email (jama1887@outlook.com)
   - Your business email (zak@millstonecompliance.com)

---

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Get Resend API key from https://resend.com/api-keys
- [ ] Add to `.env.local` (replace `re_xxxxxxxxx`)
- [ ] Restart server (stop and run `npm run dev` again)
- [ ] Complete a test assessment
- [ ] Check both email inboxes
- [ ] Check spam folders too!

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Check #1: API Key is Valid
```bash
# In .env.local, make sure it looks like:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_AbCdEfGh123456789...
# NOT:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxx
```

### Check #2: Server Restarted
Environment variables only load when the server starts. You MUST restart after changing `.env.local`.

### Check #3: Resend Dashboard
1. Go to: https://resend.com/emails
2. See if emails are being sent
3. Check for errors

### Check #4: Email Limits
Resend free tier:
- 100 emails per day
- 3,000 per month
Check you haven't hit the limit.

❌ **Emails** - Waiting for valid API key
