## HMRC Formula Added

Question 6 now includes the official recycled content calculation in the subtitle:

```
HMRC Formula: Recycled % = (recycled plastic weight ÷ total plastic weight) × 100
```

This helps users understand:
- Why exact percentages matter
- How the 30% exemption threshold is calculated
- What data they need to collect

Example: If packaging weighs 100g total and uses 32g recycled plastic:
- 32 ÷ 100 × 100 = 32% recycled content
- 32% ≥ 30% = Exempt from PPT ✓

2. **Specific obligations** - What exactly HMRC expects
