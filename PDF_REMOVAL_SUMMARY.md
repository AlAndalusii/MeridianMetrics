# PDF Download Removal - Summary

## Changes Made

I've successfully removed the PDF download functionality from your website, keeping only the email delivery system.

## What Was Removed

### From `/app/assessment/results/page.tsx`:

1. **State Variable** ‚ùå
   - Removed: `isGeneratingPDF` state

2. **Function** ‚ùå
   - Removed: `handleDownloadPDF()` function (entire PDF generation logic)

3. **Import** ‚ùå
   - Removed: `Download` icon from lucide-react imports

4. **UI Components** ‚ùå
   - Removed: "Download Professional PDF Report" button
   - Removed: PDF generation loading state

## What Remains

### Email-Only System ‚úÖ

**Enhanced Email Confirmation Section:**
- Large, centered email icon (color-coded by status)

## Current User Flow
