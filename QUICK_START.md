## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will it send duplicate emails?**
A: No! Once sent, it saves a flag and won't resend if user refreshes.

**Q: What if I want to test again?**
A: Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in console, then retake assessment.

**Q: Can I customize the email design?**
A: Yes! Edit the templates in `/app/api/send-result/route.ts`

**Q: What about abandoned assessments?**
A: Currently not captured. Want me to add database tracking? Takes 30 minutes.

**Q: Does it cost money?**
A: Resend free tier = 3,000 emails/month. Perfect to start!

**Q: Can I use my own domain instead of 'onboarding@resend.dev'?**
A: Yes! Verify your domain in Resend, then update the `from` field in the API route.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Emails not sending?**
1. Check API key is correct in `.env.local`

## 🎯 What's Next?
