# Resend Email Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Already Done

I've set up the complete email system for your assessment! Here's what's implemented:

### 📧 Two Emails Sent Automatically:

1. **User Email** - Professional results email sent to the person who completed the assessment
   - Shows their score, gaps, strengths
   - Includes recommendation and pricing
   - Beautiful, branded HTML email

2. **Business Notification** - Detailed submission sent to you at `zak@millstonecompliance.com`
   - All contact information
   - Complete assessment answers
   - Gaps analysis
   - Recommended service tier

## 🚀 Setup Instructions (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Add Your Resend API Key

1. Open the file `.env.local` in your project root
2. Replace `re_xxxxxxxxx` with your actual Resend API key:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here
BUSINESS_EMAIL=zak@millstonecompliance.com
```

### Step 2: Verify Your Domain in Resend (Recommended)

For production, you'll want to use your own domain instead of `onboarding@resend.dev`:

1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `millstonecompliance.com`)
3. Add the DNS records Resend provides
4. Once verified, update the email in `/app/api/send-result/route.ts`:

```typescript
from: 'Millstone Compliance <hello@millstonecompliance.com>',
// Instead of: from: 'Millstone Compliance <onboarding@resend.dev>',
```

### Step 3: Test It!

1. Run your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Complete the assessment at http://localhost:3000/assessment

3. Check your inbox at `zak@millstonecompliance.com` - you should receive the business notification

4. The user will receive their results email

## 📊 Data Capture Summary

### ✅ Currently Implemented:

- **LocalStorage Auto-save** - Every answer is saved locally so users can resume if they leave
- **Email notifications** - You receive all submission data via email
- **Email sent flag** - Prevents duplicate emails if user refreshes results page

### 🔄 What Happens:

1. User answers questions → Saved to localStorage (client-side)
2. User completes assessment → Redirected to results page
3. Results page loads → Automatically sends TWO emails:
   - Professional results to user
   - Complete data dump to you
4. Email sent flag saved → Won't send duplicates

## 📝 Abandoned Assessment Tracking (Next Steps)

Your current setup saves to localStorage, which means:
- ✅ User can resume if they refresh the page
- ❌ Data is lost if they use a different browser/device
- ❌ You can't see abandoned assessments

### To Add Server-Side Tracking:

If you want to capture partial/abandoned assessments, you'll need to:

1. **Add a database** (Supabase or Vercel Postgres - both free tier)
2. **Save after each answer** to the database
3. **Track completion status** (partial vs complete)
4. **Follow up with abandoned leads** via email

Would you like me to implement this? It would take about 30 minutes and give you:
- View all submissions (complete and partial)
- Follow up with people who abandoned
- Analytics on where people drop off
- Export to CSV

## 🎨 Email Templates

The emails are professionally designed with:
- Your brand colors (emerald/green)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clear CTAs (Call-to-Actions)
- Beautiful score visualization

You can customize the templates in `/app/api/send-result/route.ts` in the `generateUserEmail()` and `generateBusinessEmail()` functions.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` - your API key won't be committed to git
- ✅ API key is only used on the server (in `/app/api/send-result/route.ts`)
- ✅ Emails only sent once per assessment (prevents spam)

## 💡 Next Steps

1. Add your Resend API key to `.env.local`
2. Test the assessment flow
3. (Optional) Verify your domain in Resend
4. (Optional) Add database for abandoned assessment tracking

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Email not sending?**
- Check your API key is correct in `.env.local`
- Check the browser console for errors
- Verify the email address was entered correctly in the assessment

**Want to resend a test email?**
- Clear localStorage: Open browser console and run `localStorage.clear()`
- Complete the assessment again
