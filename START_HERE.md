## 📈 Real Example

**Scenario:** Someone starts your assessment

```
10:00 AM - Jane from "Big Corp Ltd" starts assessment
10:02 AM - Answers questions 1-7 (contact info + compliance Qs)
10:05 AM - Gets interrupted, closes browser

❌ OLD SYSTEM: Lost lead forever

✅ NEW SYSTEM:
  - All 7 answers saved to database
  - Admin dashboard shows:
    • Name: Jane Smith
    • Company: Big Corp Ltd
    • Email: jane@bigcorp.com
    • Status: Abandoned
    • Progress: 7/19 questions
  
  - You can:
    • See her company name (might be high-value!)
    • Click "Follow Up"
    • Send personalized email:
      "Hi Jane, I saw you started our assessment
      for Big Corp Ltd but got interrupted.
      Would you like to complete it or just chat?"
```

**Result:** You just captured a lead worth £500-1000 that would have been lost!
