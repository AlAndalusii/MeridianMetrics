## Question 1: How do I send professional emails via Resend?

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Here's what I built:

**Automatic email system** that sends TWO professional emails when someone completes your assessment:

#### Email #1: Beautiful Results Email to User
- Professional HTML design with your branding
- Shows their compliance score (0-100)
- Lists critical gaps with £ exposure amounts
- Highlights their strengths
- Personalized service recommendation
- Clear call-to-action to book audit
- Mobile responsive

#### Email #2: Business Notification to You
- Sent to `zak@millstonecompliance.com`
- Complete contact details
- All assessment answers
- Gaps analysis
- Service tier recommendation
- Business intelligence (goals, obstacles, budget)

**Files Created:**
- `/app/api/send-result/route.ts` - Email sending API
- Email templates built-in (customizable HTML)

**To Use:**
1. Add your Resend API key to `.env.local`:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key
   ```
2. Restart server: `npm run dev`
3. Done! Emails send automatically on assessment completion

## Question 2: How do I capture and save user data?

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Multi-layered approach:

#### Layer 1: Client-Side Auto-Save (Already Working)
Your existing code saves to **localStorage**:
- Every answer is saved immediately
- User can refresh and continue
- Progress never lost (same browser)

**Pros:** Fast, works offline, no server needed
**Cons:** Only works in same browser, you can't see the data

#### Layer 2: Email Capture (JUST IMPLEMENTED)
When user completes assessment:
- All their data is emailed to you
- You get name, email, company, phone
- All 19 answers
- Calculated score and gaps
- Business insights

**Pros:** You receive everything, can follow up
**Cons:** Only get data on completion (not if they abandon)

#### Layer 3: Database Storage (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - Optional)
Would save every answer to a database:
- Track partial completions
- See where users abandon
- Follow up with incomplete leads
- Analytics dashboard
- Export to CSV

**Want this?** I can add it in 30 minutes using:
- Supabase (free tier) or
- Vercel Postgres (free tier)

## Question 3: How do I capture data when users abandon?

### Current Situation:

**What DOES capture abandonments:**
✅ **localStorage** saves their progress
- If they return to same browser → can continue
- Data persists on their computer only
- You can't see it

**What DOESN'T capture abandonments:**
❌ **Email system** only triggers on completion
- No email = no data for you
- Can't follow up with partial leads

### 🚀 Solution: Add Database Tracking

I can implement this to capture abandonments:

```
User answers Question 1
    ↓
Save to database immediately
    ↓
User answers Question 2
    ↓
Save to database
    ↓
... (continues for each answer)
    ↓
User abandons at Question 7
    ↓
YOU still have Questions 1-7 saved!
    ↓
Follow up: "Hey, want to finish your assessment?"
```

**What you'd get:**
- See all partial assessments
- View completion rate (e.g., "60% finish")
- Analytics: "Most people abandon at Question 8"
- Email addresses of abandoners
- Follow-up opportunities

**Implementation time:** 30-45 minutes
**Cost:** Free (using free tier of database)
